     ```bash
     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

3. **Static/Media Files Not Loading**
   - Run `python manage.py collectstatic`
   - Make sure your web server is configured to serve static/media files

4. **Celery Worker Not Starting**
   - Check if Redis is running
   - Make sure you're in the virtual environment
